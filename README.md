So, we are developing ‘Pharmacy management system’ to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment and full- fledged computer software the data or the information can be stored for the short or long period of time with easy access and manipulation of the data.
The required software and hardware requirements are easy to work with. It can assist the user to concentrate on the other activities rather than record keeping. Thus, it will help the pharmacy in better utilization of its resources. 
The pharmacy can maintain computerized record without redundant entries, it discards the irrelevant data. Basically, this project describes how to manage for good performance and better service.
